        <h1>Shrines in Japan</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Shinto shrines (神社, jinja) are places of worship and the dwellings of the kami, the Shinto "gods". Sacred
                objects of worship that represent the kami are stored in the innermost chamber of the shrine where they
                cannot usually be seen by anybody. In some cases, a mountain, waterfall or rock behind the shrine
                building can be the object of worship.</p>
                <br>
            <p>People visit shrines in order to pay respect to the kami or to pray for good fortune. Shrines are also
                visited during special events such as New Year, Setsubun, Shichigosan and other festivals. New born
                babies are traditionally brought to a shrine a few weeks after birth, and many couples hold their
                wedding ceremonies there.</p>
