        <h1>How Is Technology Changing the World, and How Should the World Change Technology?</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Technologies are becoming increasingly complicated and increasingly interconnected. Cars, airplanes,
                medical devices, financial transactions, and electricity systems all rely on more computer software than
                they ever have before, making them seem both harder to understand and, in some cases, harder to control.
                Government and corporate surveillance of individuals and information processing relies largely on
                digital technologies and artificial intelligence, and therefore involves less human-to-human contact
                than ever before and more opportunities for biases to be embedded and codified in our technological
                systems in ways we may not even be able to identify or recognize. Bioengineering advances are opening up
                new terrain for challenging philosophical, political, and economic questions regarding human-natural
                relations. Additionally, the management of these large and small devices and systems is increasingly
                done through the cloud, so that control over them is both very remote and removed from direct human or
                social control. The study of how to make technologies like artificial intelligence or the Internet of
                Things “explainable” has become its own area of research because it is so difficult to understand how
                they work or what is at fault when something goes wrong</p>
