        <h1>Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humans</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Digital life is augmenting human capacities and disrupting eons-old human activities. Code-driven systems
                have spread to more than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient information and connectivity,
                offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats. As emerging algorithm-driven
                artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread, will people be better off than they are today?</p>
            <p>Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders, researchers and
                activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018.</p>
            <p>experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten
                human autonomy, agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities; that computers
                might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision-making,
                reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition, visual acuity, speech
                recognition and language translation. They said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles, in
                buildings and utilities, on farms and in business processes will save time, money and lives and offer
                opportunities for individuals to enjoy a more-customized future.</p>
