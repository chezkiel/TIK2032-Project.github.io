        <h1>Exploring Japan</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Japan is very high on many people's travel wish lists, and rightfully so! But what is Japan known for?
                Below, we'll share 30+ amazing things Japan is famous for.</p>
                <br>
            <p> Japan is my favourite country to visit. From peaceful shrines and stunning nature to high-tech
                skyscrapers and futuristic toilets, there are so many Japanese things that are worth seeing. The country
                is known to have a very distinctive culture, so it's no surprise it's famous for so many amazing things!</p>
                <br>
            <p> As Japan is an island, it was isolated from other countries and cultures for centuries. This allowed it
                to create its own, unique customs and traditions. Even though Japan takes ideas and influences from
                other countries now, it remains to be one of the most unique places in the world.</p>
