            <p>A torii (Japanese: 鳥居, [to.ɾi.i]) is a traditional Japanese gate most commonly found at the entrance of
                or within a Shinto shrine, where it symbolically marks the transition from the mundane to the sacred[1]
                and a spot where kami are welcomed and thought to travel through.</p>
                <br>
            <p> presence of a torii at the entrance is usually the simplest way to identify Shinto shrines, and a
                small torii icon represents them on Japanese road maps.</p>
                <br>
            <p> first appearance of torii gates in Japan can be reliably pinpointed to at least the mid-Heian
                period; they are mentioned in a text written in 922.[1] The oldest existing stone torii was built in the
                12th century and belongs to a Hachiman shrine in Yamagata Prefecture. The oldest existing wooden torii
                is a ryōbu torii (see description below) at Kubō Hachiman Shrine in Yamanashi Prefecture built in
                1535.</p>
                <br>
            <p> gates were traditionally made from wood or stone, but today they can be also made of reinforced
                concrete, stainless steel or other materials. They are usually either unpainted or painted vermilion
                with a black upper lintel. Shrines of Inari, the kami of fertility and industry, typically have many
                torii because those who have been successful in business often donate torii in gratitude. Fushimi
                Inari-taisha in Kyoto has thousands of such torii, each bearing the donor's name.</p>
